# Button Debounce

 Pushbuttons often generate improper open/close transitions when pressed, due to mechanical and physical issues: these transitions may be read as multiple presses in a very short time fooling the program, without debouncing, pressing the button once may cause unpredictable results.

 This library keep track of the time passed since the button was pressed to deal with this issue.

 Usage
============

## SETUP


Declare a `ButtonDebouce` object with `pinNumber` and `timeMillis` to debounce as parameter, and defined a callback function.

Example:

```
void onButtonChange(int state) {
  Serial.println("Changed: " + String(state));
}
ButtonDebounce button(3, 250); // PIN 3 with 250ms debounce time
button.setCallback(onButtonChange);
```

Important: buttons donÂ´t share resources. The following methods are avaliable.

* `update()` called in `loop method`, used to verify the debounce timer and the button state changes.
* `state()` return the last button state.
* `setCallback(function)` set the callback function that will executed on button state changes.


## LOOP

Due the time buffer used in each button, please call the `update()` method in `loop`, so it can be update and reflect all state changes.

    Be advised: Do not declare any delay() before the update functions, as it may interfere with the bounce time buffer.


```
void loop() {
  buttonUp.update();
  buttonDown.update();
}
```
